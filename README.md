# Introduction

This is a website to show my portfolio of projects, it features an admin page where I can manage my projects and add new ones.

Feel free to read more about this project on my [dev-blog](https://bats.li/project/010101)

# Setup

The current projects are filled with some examples of mine, feel free to delete them and setup your own Spawnpoint instance
with docker or directly with nodejs.

The default admin password is "password444" and should immediately be changed, it is stored at `./app/database/config.json`
