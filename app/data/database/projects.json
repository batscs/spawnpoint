It provides a robust backend API and an extensible frontend interface to enable seamless integration of plugins, making it an ideal home for projects that require a scalable and customizable plugin management system.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Pangolin is built around the concept of plugins (or scales), which are independent modules that can be managed, started, stopped, or configured dynamically without affecting the core system.\r\n  \r\n- **Dynamic Plugin Loading**: Automatically loads plugins from a specified directory and registers them with the core application. Plugins are loaded only when needed, allowing for efficient resource management.\r\n\r\n- **Flexible Permissions**: Each plugin defines its own permissions, which can be checked by the core system. This enables granular access control for different users. Declare managers who can grant or deny permissions for users, or manage the plugin lifecyles.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Plugin Endpoints**: Plugins can define and expose their own API endpoints, making it easy for developers to build custom functionality that interacts with the system.\r\n\r\n- **Customizable Plugin Settings**: Plugins can define settings that can be modified through a unified interface, giving each plugin control over its configuration.\r\n\r\n- **Front-End Integration**: Pangolin includes a navigation bar that dynamically updates based on user permissions, ensuring that users only see plugins they have access to.\r\n\r\n- **Extensible Plugins**: Pangolin Plugins are required to implement a typescript plugin interface, however there are no restrictions to how you implement it. You can pass the logic to your own implementation in your favorite language.","isPublished":true,"startDate":"2024-09-01","endDate":"","source":"https://git.bats.li/bats/pangolin","preview":"","banner":"94378899-2d61-4515-a435-fe92eb5fdd94.png"},{"id":"010101","name":"spawnpoint","topics":["website"],"details":["nodejs","expressjs","scalable"],"description":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nWelcome to **Project Spawnpoint**, the website I am currently working on. It’s a complete rework of my old homepage, which has been long overdue for an upgrade. While the previous version served its purpose, it was built with PHP and lacked scalability, which became more and more of a pain as I continued to add projects.\r\n\r\nThis new version is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, allowing for a much more scalable approach. The main reason for this rework was to make the website adaptable for future growth while also introducing an **admin panel** that enables me to manage projects with ease. Now, I can add new projects and update information without diving into the code every time. All the data is saved persistently, making it far more efficient to handle.\r\n\r\n# Intention\r\nIn contrast to **Spawnpoint**, the old website forced me to manually edit the code every time I wanted to add a new project, which was far from ideal. While it worked in the early stages, it quickly became frustrating and time-consuming. This new system streamlines the process and gives me the flexibility to scale as needed, without having to worry about the technical limitations of the past, thanks to the implementation of an admin panel.\r\n\r\n![image](/static/resources/media/982741e2-63f2-4519-b772-0f09959e722a.png)\r\n\r\n# Implementation Details\r\n\r\n## Authorization\r\nAs this web app is not intended to provide access to multiple users, password authorization has been chosen for the admin panel. On successful login, a server-side generated token is associated with the user (saved as a cookie). On each HTTP request to the admin panel, the cookie is verified to ensure it is still valid to prevent unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n## Front- & Back-End Separation\r\nAlso, different from the previous iteration of this website, which was a monolith made entirely out of PHP, HTML, and CSS, this project has a proper backend and an independent front-end. The front-end has been implemented with the templating language **Pug**, which is translated into **HTML**.\r\n\r\n## Persistence\r\nAll projects are saved in a JSON database. JSON was chosen because it is a lot less performance- and storage-demanding than a relational database, as the only overhead is ensuring data integrity. Since the points of failure are manageable (editing and creating projects), this is not a significant issue.\r\n\r\nA database cache has also been implemented, which caches all results accessed by users for a set amount of time. The downside is that changes may only be visible after the cache expires, but the upside is that frequent reading of the file is prevented. Since changes aren’t expected often, this is a net positive.\r\n\r\n## Flexibility\r\nEach project can have its own description, which supports markdown when editing in the admin panel and renders accordingly when visited by users. This was made to allow the admin (me) to create very flexible descriptions of projects and dynamically include pictures and code blocks.\r\n\r\n![image](/static/resources/media/7f92db85-0eac-49fe-a8f7-c3fb9cb0273c.png)\r\n\r\n## Blog Posts (discarded)\r\nInitially, I planned to have a blog for each project where new posts could be added and existing ones edited through the admin panel. However, I discarded this idea because it wouldn’t provide much additional benefit over the description field (other than perhaps separating blog posts or comments). Updates can still be added in the current description and visualized with markdown, for example:\r\n\r\n> Update: 2024 September 15th  \r\n> Today I decided not to work on this project and went shopping.\r\n","isPublished":true,"startDate":"2024-07-04","endDate":"2024-08-04","source":"http://localhost:3000","preview":"https://git.bats.li","banner":"168b84e7-0f43-49a2-8061-15d68866580d.png"},{"id":"5dc16c3d-60a7-4e5d-b29d-c35d82c4be31","name":"Linux

My Case arrived 2 weeks later than the rest, so I had to use it without it during that time. For a short while I was using a **NZXT Kraken x63** all-in-one watercooler.

Here I got my first gaming PC coming from a cheap Laptop. Finally ready to fully enjoy Minecraft PvP. Unfortunately I didn't took many pictures of it back then. It was a pre-build PC from Amazon because I didn't know any better. However, it did it's job. Thanks BashPVP for the recommendation! I did upgrade the fans at some point to BeQuiet!
