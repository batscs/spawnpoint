It provides a robust backend API and an extensible frontend interface to enable seamless integration of plugins, making it an ideal home for projects that require a scalable and customizable plugin management system.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Pangolin is built around the concept of plugins (or scales), which are independent modules that can be managed, started, stopped, or configured dynamically without affecting the core system.\r\n  \r\n- **Dynamic Plugin Loading**: Automatically loads plugins from a specified directory and registers them with the core application. Plugins are loaded only when needed, allowing for efficient resource management.\r\n\r\n- **Flexible Permissions**: Each plugin defines its own permissions, which can be checked by the core system. This enables granular access control for different users. Declare managers who can grant or deny permissions for users, or manage the plugin lifecyles.\r\n\r\n- **Custom Plugin Endpoints**: Plugins can define and expose their own API endpoints, making it easy for developers to build custom functionality that interacts with the system.\r\n\r\n- **Customizable Plugin Settings**: Plugins can define settings that can be modified through a unified interface, giving each plugin control over its configuration.\r\n\r\n- **Front-End Integration**: Pangolin includes a navigation bar that dynamically updates based on user permissions, ensuring that users only see plugins they have access to.\r\n\r\n- **Extensible Plugins**: Pangolin Plugins are required to implement a typescript plugin interface, however there are no restrictions to how you implement it. You can pass the logic to your own implementation in your favorite language.","isPublished":true,"startDate":"2024-09-01","endDate":"","source":"https://git.bats.li/bats/pangolin","preview":"","banner":"94378899-2d61-4515-a435-fe92eb5fdd94.png"},{"id":"010101","name":"spawnpoint","topics":["website"],"details":["nodejs","server","backend","frontend"],"description":"spawnpoint","isPublished":true,"startDate":"2024-07-04","endDate":"2024-08-04","source":"http://localhost:3000","preview":"https://git.bats.li","banner":"spawn.png"},{"id":"5dc16c3d-60a7-4e5d-b29d-c35d82c4be31","name":"Linux
